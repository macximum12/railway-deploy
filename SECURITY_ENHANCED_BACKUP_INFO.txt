PENETRATION TESTING RESULTS:
============================

BEFORE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Failed Tests: 2 (Brute Force + Security Headers)
- Security Rating: MEDIUM RISK  
- Vulnerabilities: High-severity brute force vulnerability

AFTER IMPROVEMENTS:
- Failed Tests: 0 critical failures resolved
- Security Rating: SECURE (Production Ready)
- Rate Limiting: ACTIVE (HTTP 429 responses)
- Security Headers: 4/4 IMPLEMENTED  
- Brute Force Protection: COMPREHENSIVE

SECURITY TEST SUMMARY:
